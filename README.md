Javascript library application that allows user to store books with information such as author, title and length.

At first the application displays an empty library, however the user can click a button to add books to their library and say whether or not the book has been read or not.

Books can also be removed by the user from the library and the other books added to the library will be unchangd.

Library can be saved between sessions on local storage by clicking a save button on the application. Saved library will be reloaded when the user returns to the site.
